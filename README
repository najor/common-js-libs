Common Shared JavaScript Libraries
----------------------------------

Herein contained are a number of popular JavaScript libraries that are often
used as basic frameworks, and utilities across many of our projects.

These libraries have been slightly modified, where necessary, such that they
expose their API via define() calls so that they can be used as CommonJS
modules.

Also contained is one module-paths.js file which contains a mapping of all
shared CommonJS modules files provided by all our libraries.

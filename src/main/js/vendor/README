Common Shared JavaScript Libraries
----------------------------------

The files contained in this repository make up popular common JavaScript
libraries that are often used as basic frameworks and utilities on many of our
JavaScript projects.

Where necessary, these files are modified versions of the original release
files, where we have wrapped the functionality in a define() call in order to
export the libraries API as a CommonJS module.
